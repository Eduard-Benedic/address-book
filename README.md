In order to see the application running simply fetch the repository on your computer, install all the necessary packages with npm or yarn and please make sure you include an **.env.local** file in the **root** directory. Inside that file add your API key with this name 

**REACT_APP_API_SECRET=YOUR-API-KEY**.
This key is used inside the `AddressBookAPI.ts` file.

I had fun creating this app and looking forward to hearing back from the team.
